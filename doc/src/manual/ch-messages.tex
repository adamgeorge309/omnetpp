\chapter{Messages and Packets}
\label{cha:messages}

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:msgs:overview}

Messages are a central concept in {\opp}. In the model, message objects
represent events, packets, commands, jobs, customers, or other kinds of
entities, depending on the model domain.

Messages are represented with the \cclass{cMessage} class and its subclass
\cclass{cPacket}. \cclass{cPacket} is used for network packets (frames,
datagrams, transport packets, etc.) in a communication network, and
\cclass{cMessage} is used for everything else. Users are free to subclass
both \cclass{cMessage} and \cclass{cPacket} to create new types and to
add data.

\cclass{cMessage} has the following fields; some are used by
the simulation kernel, and others are provided for the convenience
of the simulation programmer:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The \textit{name} field is a string (\ttt{const char *}),
    which can be freely used by the simulation programmer. The message's
    name is displayed in many places in the graphical runtime interface,
    so it is generally useful to choose a descriptive name. The message's
    name is inherited from \cclass{cObject} (see section
    \ref{sec:sim-lib:cobject}).
  \item \textit{Message kind} is an integer field.
    Some negative values are reserved by the simulation library, but zero
    and positive values can be freely used in the model for any purpose.
    The message kind is typically used to carry a value that conveys the
    role, type, category, or identity of the message.
  \item The \textit{scheduling priority} field is used by the simulation
    kernel to determine the delivery order of messages that have the same
    arrival time values. This field is rarely used in practice.
  \item The \textit{send time}, \textit{arrival time}, \textit{source module},
    \textit{source gate}, \textit{destination module}, \textit{destination gate}
    fields store information about the message's last sending or scheduling,
    and should not be modified from the model. These fields are primarily
    used internally by the simulation kernel while the message is in the
    future events set (FES)\index{FES}, but the information is still in
    the message object when the message is delivered to a module.
  \item \textit{Time stamp} (not to be confused with \textit{arrival time})
    is a utility field that the programmer can freely use for any purpose.
    The time stamp is not examined or changed by the simulation kernel at all.
  \item The \textit{parameter list}, \textit{control info}, and
    \textit{context pointer} fields make some simulation tasks easier
    to program, and they will be discussed later.
\end{itemize}

The \cclass{cPacket} class extends \cclass{cMessage} with fields that are
useful for representing network packets:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The \textit{packet length} field represents the length of the packet
    in bits. It is used by the simulation kernel to compute the transmission
    duration when a packet travels through a connection that has an assigned
    data rate, and also for error modeling on channels with a nonzero
    bit error rate.
  \item The \textit{encapsulated packet} field helps in modeling protocol layers
    by supporting the concept of encapsulation and decapsulation.
  \item The \textit{bit error flag} field carries the result of error
    modeling after the packet is sent through a channel that has a nonzero
    packet error rate (PER) or bit error rate (BER). It is up to the receiver
    to examine this flag after receiving the packet and to act upon it.
  \item The \textit{duration} field carries the transmission duration after
    the packet was sent through a channel with a data rate.
  \item The \textit{is-reception-start} flag tells whether this packet
    represents the start or the end of the reception after the packet has travelled
    through a channel with a data rate. This flag is controlled by the
    \textit{deliver-on-reception-start} flag of the receiving gate.
\end{itemize}


\section{The cMessage Class}
\label{sec:msgs:cmessage}

\subsection{Basic Usage}
\label{sec:messages:cmessage-basic-usage}

The \cclass{cMessage} constructor accepts an \textit{object name} and a
\textit{message kind}, both optional:

\begin{cpp}
cMessage(const char *name=nullptr, short kind=0);
\end{cpp}

Descriptive message names can be very useful when tracing, debugging or
demonstrating the simulation, so it is recommended to use them.
Message kind is usually initialized with a symbolic constant
(e.g. an \textit{enum} value) which signals what the message object
represents. Only positive values and zero can be used --
negative values are reserved for use by the simulation kernel.

The following lines show some examples of message creation:

\begin{cpp}
cMessage *msg1 = new cMessage();
cMessage *msg2 = new cMessage("timeout");
cMessage *msg3 = new cMessage("timeout", KIND_TIMEOUT);
\end{cpp}

Once a message has been created, its basic data members can be set
with the following methods:

\begin{cpp}
void setName(const char *name);
void setKind(short k);
void setTimestamp();
void setTimestamp(simtime_t t);
void setSchedulingPriority(short p);
\end{cpp}

The argument-less \ffunc{setTimeStamp()} method is equivalent to
\ttt{setTimeStamp(simTime())}.

The corresponding getter methods are:

\begin{cpp}
const char *getName() const;
short getKind() const;
simtime_t getTimestamp() const;
short getSchedulingPriority() const;
\end{cpp}

The \ffunc{getName()}/\ffunc{setName()} methods are inherited from
a generic base class in the simulation library, \cclass{cNamedObject}.

Two more interesting methods:

\begin{cpp}
bool isPacket() const;
simtime_t getCreationTime() const;
\end{cpp}

The \ffunc{isPacket()} method returns \ttt{true} if the particular message
object is a subclass of \cclass{cPacket}, and \ttt{false} otherwise. As
\ffunc{isPacket()} is implemented as a virtual function that just contains
a \ttt{return false} or a \ttt{return true} statement, it might be faster
than calling \ttt{dynamic\_cast<cPacket*>}.

The \ffunc{getCreationTime()} method returns the creation time of the
message. It is worthwhile to mention that with cloned messages (see
\ffunc{dup()} later), the creation time of the original message is returned
and not the time of the cloning operation. This is particularly useful when
modeling communication protocols, because many protocols clone the
transmitted packages to be able to do retransmissions and/or
segmentation/reassembly.


\subsection{Duplicating Messages}
\label{sec:messages:duplicating-messages}
\index{message!duplication}

It is often necessary to duplicate a message or a packet, for example,
to send one and keep a copy. Duplication can be done in the same way as
for any other {\opp} object:

\begin{cpp}
cMessage *copy = msg->dup();
\end{cpp}

The resulting message (or packet) will be an exact copy of the original
including message parameters and encapsulated messages, except for the
message ID field. The creation time field is also copied, so
for cloned messages \ffunc{getCreationTime()} will return the creation
time of the original, not the time of the cloning operation.
  \footnote{Note, however, that the simulation library may delay the
  duplication of the encapsulated message until it is really needed;
  see section \ref{sec:messages:reference-counting}.}

When subclassing \cclass{cMessage} or \cclass{cPacket}, one needs
to reimplement \ffunc{dup()}. The recommended implementation is to delegate
to the copy constructor of the new class:

\begin{cpp}
class FooMessage : public cMessage {
  public:
    FooMessage(const FooMessage& other) {...}
    virtual FooMessage *dup() const {return new FooMessage(*this);}
    ...
};
\end{cpp}

For generated classes (chapter \ref{cha:msg-def}), this is
taken care of automatically.


\subsection{Message IDs}
\label{sec:messages:message-ids}
\index{message!IDs}

Every message object has a unique numeric \textit{message ID}. It is normally
used for identifying the message in a recorded event log file, but may occasionally
be useful for other purposes as well. When a message is cloned (\ttt{msg->dup()}),
the clone will have a different ID.

There is also another ID called \textit{tree ID}. The tree ID is initialized
to the message ID. However, when a message is cloned, the clone will retain
the tree ID of the original. Thus, messages that have been created by cloning
the same message or its clones will have the same tree ID.  Message IDs are
of the type \ttt{long}, which is is usually enough so that IDs remain unique
during the simulation run (i.e. the counter does not wrap).

The methods for obtaining message IDs:

\begin{cpp}
long getId() const;
long getTreeId() const;
\end{cpp}


\subsection{Control Info}
\label{sec:messages:control-info}

One of the main application areas of {\opp} is the simulation of
telecommunication networks. Here, protocol layers are usually
implemented as modules which exchange packets. Packets themselves
are represented by messages subclassed from \cclass{cPacket}.

However, communication between protocol layers requires sending
additional information to be attached to packets. For example,
a TCP implementation sending down a TCP packet to IP will want
to specify the destination IP address and possibly
other parameters. When IP passes up a packet to TCP after
decapsulation from the IP header, it will want to let TCP know
at least the source IP address.

This additional information is represented by \textit{control info} objects
in {\opp}. Control info objects have to be subclassed from \cclass{cObject}
(a small footprint base class with no data members), and can be attached to
any message. \cclass{cMessage} has the following methods for this purpose:

\begin{cpp}
void setControlInfo(cObject *controlInfo);
cObject *getControlInfo() const;
cObject *removeControlInfo();
\end{cpp}

When a "command" is associated with the message sending (such as
TCP OPEN, SEND, CLOSE, etc), the message kind field (\ttt{getKind()},
\ttt{setKind()} methods of \ttt{cMessage}) should carry the command code.
When the command doesn't involve a data packet (e.g.
TCP CLOSE command), a dummy packet (empty \ttt{cMessage}) can be sent.

An object set as control info via \ffunc{setControlInfo()} will be owned
by the message object. When the message is deallocated, the control
info object is deleted as well.


\subsection{Information About the Last Arrival}
\label{sec:messages:information-about-last-arrival}

The following methods return the sending and arrival times that correspond
to the last sending of the message.

\begin{cpp}
simtime_t getSendingTime() const;
simtime_t getArrivalTime() const;
\end{cpp}

The following methods can be used to determine where the message came from
and which gate it arrived on (or will arrive if it is currently scheduled
or under way.) There are two sets of methods, one returning module/gate Ids,
and the other returning pointers.

\begin{cpp}
int getSenderModuleId() const;
int getSenderGateId() const;
int getArrivalModuleId() const;
int getArrivalGateId() const;
cModule *getSenderModule() const;
cGate *getSenderGate() const;
cModule *getArrivalModule() const;
cGate *getArrivalGate() const;
\end{cpp}

There are further convenience functions to tell whether
the message arrived on a specific gate given with id or
with name and index.

\begin{cpp}
bool arrivedOn(int gateId) const;
bool arrivedOn(const char *gatename) const;
bool arrivedOn(const char *gatename, int gateindex) const;
\end{cpp}


\subsection{Display String}
\label{sec:messages:displaystring}

\textit{Display strings} affect the message's visualization in graphical
user interfaces like Qtenv. Message objects do not store a
display string by default, but contain a \ffunc{getDisplayString()} method
that can be overridden in subclasses to return the desired string.  The
method:

\begin{cpp}
const char *getDisplayString() const;
\end{cpp}

Since {\opp} version 5.1, \cclass{cPacket}'s default \ffunc{getDisplayString()}
implementation is such so that a packet ``inherits'' the display string of its
encapsulated packet, provided it has one. Thus, in the model of a network stack,
the appearance of e.g. an application layer packet will be preserved even
after multiple levels of encapsulation.

See section \label{sec:graphics:message-displaystrings} for
more information on message display string syntax and possibilities.



\section{Self-Messages}
\label{sec:msgs:self-messages}

\subsection{Using a Message as Self-Message}
\label{sec:messages:using-message-as-self-message}

Messages are often used to represent events internal to a module,
such as a periodically firing timer to represent the expiry of a timeout.
A message is termed a \textit{self-message} when it is used
in such a scenario -- otherwise, self-messages are normal messages
of the \cclass{cMessage} class or a class derived from it.

When a message is delivered to a module by the simulation kernel, the
\ffunc{isSelfMessage()} method can be used to determine if it is
a self-message; that is, whether it was scheduled with \ffunc{scheduleAt()},
or sent with one of the \ffunc{send...()} methods. The \ffunc{isScheduled()}
method returns true if the message is currently scheduled. A scheduled
message can also be cancelled using \ffunc{cancelEvent()}.

\begin{cpp}
bool isSelfMessage() const;
bool isScheduled() const;
\end{cpp}

The methods \ffunc{getSendingTime()} and \cclass{getArrivalTime()} are also
useful with self-messages: they return the time the message was scheduled
and arrived (or will arrive; while the message is scheduled, arrival time
is the time it will be delivered to the module).


\subsection{Context Pointer}
\label{sec:messages:context-pointer}

The \cclass{cMessage} class contains a \textit{context pointer} of type \ttt{void*},
which can be accessed by the following functions:

\begin{cpp}
void setContextPointer(void *p);
void *getContextPointer() const;
\end{cpp}

The context pointer is not used or memory-managed by the simulation kernel. It
is typically used in modules that manage multiple self-messages or timers to
distinguish which specific timer has triggered upon message arrival. By pointing
to a module's internal data structure, this pointer can convey essential
information about the event's context.


\section{The cPacket Class}
\label{sec:msgs:cpacket}

\subsection{Basic Usage}
\label{sec:messages:cpacket-basic-usage}

The \cclass{cPacket} constructor is similar to the \cclass{cMessage}
constructor, but it accepts an additional \textit{bit length} argument:

\begin{cpp}
cPacket(const char *name=nullptr, short kind=0, int64 bitLength=0);
\end{cpp}

The most important field that \cclass{cPacket} has over \cclass{cMessage} is
the message length. This field is kept in bits, but it can also be
set/get in bytes. If the bit length is not a multiple of eight, the
\ffunc{getByteLength()} method will round it up.

\begin{cpp}
void setBitLength(int64_t l);
void setByteLength(int64_t l);
void addBitLength(int64_t delta);
void addByteLength(int64_t delta);
int64_t getBitLength() const;
int64_t getByteLength() const;
\end{cpp}

Another extra field is the bit error flag. It can be accessed with the
following methods:

\begin{cpp}
void setBitError(bool e);
bool hasBitError() const;
\end{cpp}


\subsection{Identifying the Protocol}
\label{sec:messages:identifying-protocol-of-packet}

In the {\opp} protocol models, the protocol type is usually represented in the
message subclass. For example, instances of the \ttt{IPv6Datagram}
class represent IPv6 datagrams and \ttt{EthernetFrame} represents Ethernet
frames. The C++ \ttt{dynamic\_cast} operator can be used to determine if a
message object is of a specific protocol.

An example:

\begin{cpp}
cMessage *msg = receive();
if (dynamic_cast<IPv6Datagram *>(msg) != nullptr) {
    IPv6Datagram *datagram = (IPv6Datagram *)msg;
    ...
}
\end{cpp}


\subsection{Information About the Last Transmission}
\label{sec:messages:information-about-last-transmission}

When a packet has been received, some information can be obtained
about the transmission, namely the \textit{transmission duration}
and the \textit{is-reception-start} flag. They are returned by
the following methods:

\begin{cpp}
simtime_t getDuration() const;
bool isReceptionStart() const;
\end{cpp}


\subsection{Encapsulating Packets}
\label{sec:messages:encapsulating-packets}

When modeling layered protocols of computer networks, it is commonly
needed to encapsulate a packet\index{packet!encapsulation} into another.
The following \cclass{cPacket} methods are associated with encapsulation:

\begin{cpp}
void encapsulate(cPacket *packet);
cPacket *decapsulate();
cPacket *getEncapsulatedPacket() const;
\end{cpp}

The \ffunc{encapsulate()} function encapsulates a packet into another one.
The length of the packet will grow by the length of the encapsulated
packet. An exception: when the encapsulating (outer) packet has zero
length, {\opp} assumes it is not a real packet but an out-of-band signal,
so its length is left at zero.

A packet can only hold one encapsulated packet at a time; the second
\ffunc{encapsulate()} call will result in an error. It is also an error if
the packet to be encapsulated is not owned by the module.

Decapsulation, that is, removing the encapsulated packet, is done by the
\ffunc{decapsulate()} method. \ffunc{decapsulate()} will decrease the
length of the packet accordingly, except if it was zero. If the length
would become negative, an error occurs.

The \ffunc{getEncapsulatedPacket()} function returns a pointer to the
encapsulated packet, or \ttt{nullptr} if no packet is encapsulated.

Example usage:

\begin{cpp}
cPacket *data = new cPacket("data");
data->setByteLength(1024);

UDPPacket *udp = new UDPPacket("udp"); // subclassed from cPacket
udp->setByteLength(8);

udp->encapsulate(data);
EV << udp->getByteLength() << endl; // --> 8+1024 = 1032
\end{cpp}

And the corresponding decapsulation code:

\begin{cpp}
cPacket *payload = udp->decapsulate();
\end{cpp}



\subsection{Reference Counting}
\label{sec:messages:reference-counting}

Since the 3.2 release, {\opp} implements reference counting of encapsulated
packets, meaning that when a packet containing an encapsulated packet is
cloned (\ffunc{dup()}), the encapsulated packet will not be duplicated,
only a reference count is incremented. Duplication of
the encapsulated packet is deferred until \ffunc{decapsulate()}
actually gets called. If the outer packet is deleted without its
\ffunc{decapsulate()} method ever being called, then the reference
count of the encapsulated packet is simply decremented. The
encapsulated packet is deleted when its reference count reaches
zero.

Reference counting can significantly improve performance, especially
in LAN and wireless scenarios. For example, in the simulation of a
broadcast LAN or WLAN, the IP, TCP and higher layer packets won't
be duplicated (and then discarded without being used) if the
MAC address doesn't match in the first place.

The reference counting mechanism works transparently. However, there
is one implication: \tbf{one must not change anything in a packet
that is encapsulated into another!} That is,
\ffunc{getEncapsulatedPacket()} should be viewed as if it returned a
pointer to a read-only object (it returns a \ttt{const} pointer
indeed), for quite obvious reasons: the encapsulated packet may be
shared between several packets, and any change would affect those
other packets as well.


\subsection{Encapsulating Several Packets}
\label{sec:messages:encapsulating-several-packets}

The \cclass{cPacket} class does not directly support encapsulating more
than one packet, but one can subclass \cclass{cPacket} or \cclass{cMessage}
to add the necessary functionality.

Encapsulated packets can be stored in a fixed-size or a dynamically
allocated array, or in a standard container like \ttt{std::vector}.
In addition to storage, object ownership needs to be taken care of as well.
The message class has to \textbf{take ownership} of the inserted messages, and
\textbf{release} them when they are removed from the message. These tasks are
done via the \ffunc{take()} and \ffunc{drop()} methods.

Here is an example that assumes that the class has an \ttt{std::list} member
called \ttt{messages} for storing message pointers:

\begin{cpp}
void MultiMessage::insertMessage(cMessage *msg)
{
    take(msg);  // take ownership
    messages.push_back(msg);  // store pointer
}

void MultiMessage::removeMessage(cMessage *msg)
{
    messages.remove(msg);  // remove pointer
    drop(msg);  // release ownership
}
\end{cpp}

One also needs to provide an \ffunc{operator=()} method to make sure that
message objects are copied and duplicated properly. Section
\ref{sec:sim-lib:deriving-new-classes} covers requirements and conventions
associated with deriving new classes in more detail.



\section{Attaching Objects To a Message}
\label{sec:msgs:attaching-objects}

When parameters or objects need to be added to a message, the preferred
way to do so is via message definitions, as described in chapter
\ref{cha:msg-def}.


\subsection{Attaching Objects}
\label{sec:messages:attaching-objects}

The \cclass{cMessage} class has an internal \cclass{cArray} object that
can carry objects. Only objects derived from \cclass{cObject} can be attached.
The \ffunc{addObject()}, \ffunc{getObject()},
\ffunc{hasObject()}, and \ffunc{removeObject()} methods use the object's name
(as returned by the \ffunc{getName()} method) as the key to the array.

An example where the sender attaches an object, and the receiver
checks for the object's existence and obtains a pointer to it:

\begin{cpp}
// sender:
cHistogram *histogram = new cHistogram("histogram");
msg->addObject(histogram);

// receiver:
if (msg->hasObject("histogram")) {
   cObject *obj = msg->getObject("histogram");
   cHistogram *histogram = check_and_cast<cHistogram *>(obj);
   ...
}
\end{cpp}

One needs to ensure that the names of the attached objects don't
conflict with each other. Note that message parameters (\cclass{cMsgPar},
see the next section) are also attached in the same way, so their names
also count.

When no objects are attached to a message (and \ffunc{getParList()} is not
invoked), the internal \cclass{cArray} object is not created.
This saves both storage and execution time.

Non-\cclass{cObject} data can be attached to messages by wrapping them into
\cclass{cObject}, for example into \cclass{cMsgPar}, which has been designed
specifically for this purpose. \cclass{cMsgPar} will be covered in the next
section.

\subsection{Attaching Parameters}
\label{sec:messages:attaching-parameters}

The preferred way to extend messages with new data fields is to use
message definitions (see chapter \ref{cha:msg-def}).

The old and deprecated way of adding new fields to messages is by
attaching \cclass{cMsgPar} objects.
There are several downsides to this approach, with the worst being
large memory and execution time overhead. \cclass{cMsgPar}s are
heavyweight and fairly complex objects themselves.
It has been reported that using \cclass{cMsgPar} message parameters
might account for a large part of execution time, sometimes as much as 80\%.
Using \cclass{cMsgPar} is also error-prone because \cclass{cMsgPar} objects
have to be added dynamically and individually to each message object.
In contrast, subclassing benefits from static type checking:
if one mistypes the name of a field in the C++ code, the compiler
can detect the mistake.

If one still needs \cclass{cMsgPar}s for some reason, here is a short summary.
At the sender side, one can add a new named parameter to the message
with the \ffunc{addPar()} member function, and then set its value with
one of the methods \ffunc{setBoolValue()}, \ffunc{setLongValue()},
\ffunc{setStringValue()}, \ffunc{setDoubleValue()}, \ffunc{setPointerValue()},
\ffunc{setObjectValue()}, and \ffunc{setXMLValue()}. There are also overloaded
assignment operators for the corresponding C/C++ types.

At the receiver side, one can look up the parameter object on the message
by name and obtain a reference to it with the \ffunc{par()} member function.
\ffunc{hasPar()} can be used to first check whether the message object has a parameter
object with the given name. Then the value can be read with the methods
\ffunc{boolValue()}, \ffunc{longValue()}, \ffunc{stringValue()},
\ffunc{doubleValue()}, \ffunc{pointerValue()}, \ffunc{objectValue()},
\ffunc{xmlValue()}, or by using the provided overloaded type cast operators.

Example usage:

\begin{cpp}
msg->addPar("destAddr");
msg->par("destAddr").setLongValue(168);
...
long destAddr = msg->par("destAddr").longValue();
\end{cpp}

Or, using overloaded operators:

\begin{cpp}
msg->addPar("destAddr");
msg->par("destAddr") = 168;
...
long destAddr = msg->par("destAddr");
\end{cpp}
