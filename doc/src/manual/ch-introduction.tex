\section{What Is {\opp}?}
\label{sec:introduction:what-is-omnetpp}

{\opp} is an object-oriented modular discrete event network simulation
framework. It has a generic architecture, so it can be (and has been)
used in various problem domains:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Modeling of wired and wireless communication networks.
  \item Protocol modeling.
  \item Modeling of queueing networks.
  \item Modeling of multiprocessors and other distributed hardware systems.
  \item Validation of hardware architectures.
  \item Evaluating performance aspects of complex software systems.
  \item In general, modeling and simulation of any system where the
    discrete event approach is suitable, and can be conveniently
    mapped into entities communicating by exchanging messages.
\end{itemize}

{\opp} itself is not a simulator of anything concrete, but rather
provides infrastructure and tools for \textit{writing} simulations. One of
the fundamental ingredients of this infrastructure is a component
architecture for simulation models. Models are assembled from reusable
components termed \textit{modules}. Well-written modules are truly reusable
and can be combined in various ways, like LEGO blocks.

Modules can be connected with each other via gates (other systems would
call them ports) and combined to form compound modules. The depth of
module nesting is not limited. Modules communicate through message passing,
where messages may carry arbitrary data structures. Modules can pass
messages along predefined paths via gates and connections or directly to
their destination. The latter is useful for wireless simulations, for
example. Modules may have parameters that can be used to customize module
behavior and/or to parameterize the model's topology.
Modules at the lowest level of the module hierarchy are called
simple modules and encapsulate model behavior. Simple modules
are programmed in C++ and make use of the simulation library.

{\opp} simulations can be run under various user interfaces.
Graphical, animating user interfaces are highly useful for
demonstration and debugging purposes, and command-line user
interfaces are best for batch execution.

The simulator as well as user interfaces and tools are highly portable.
They are tested on the most common operating systems (Linux, macOS,
Windows) and they can be compiled out of the box or after trivial
modifications on most Unix-like operating systems.

{\opp} also supports parallel distributed simulation. {\opp} can
use several mechanisms for communication between partitions of
a parallel distributed simulation, for example, MPI or named pipes.
The parallel simulation algorithm can easily be extended, or new
ones can be plugged in. Models do not need any special instrumentation
to be run in parallel -- it is just a matter of configuration.
{\opp} can even be used for classroom presentation of parallel
simulation algorithms because simulations can be run in parallel
even under the GUI that provides detailed feedback on what is going on.

{\omnest} is the commercially supported version of {\omnetpp}.
{\omnetpp} is free only for academic and non-profit use;
for commercial purposes, one needs to obtain {\omnest} licenses
from Simulcraft Inc.


% \section{Where Does {\opp} Stand in the World of Simulation Tools?}
% \label{sec:introduction:where-does-opp-stand-in-world-of-simulation-tools}
%
% There are numerous network simulation tools available on the market today,
% both commercial and non-commercial. In this section, I will provide
% an overview by selecting some of the most important or
% representative tools from both categories and comparing them
% to {\opp}: PARSEC, SMURPH, NS, Ptolemy, NetSim++, C++SIM, CLASS
% as non-commercial options, and OPNET, COMNET III as commercial tools.
% (The {\opp} Home Page contains a list of websites with collections
% of references to network simulation tools where readers can
% find a more comprehensive list.) In the commercial category, OPNET
% is widely considered to be the state of the art in network simulation.
% {\opp} targets a similar segment of network simulation
% as OPNET.
%
% Seven aspects will be examined to provide an overview of network
% simulation tools:
%
%
% \textbf{Detail Level}. \textit{Does the simulation tool have the necessary
% capabilities to express details in the model?} In other words, can users
% implement arbitrary new building blocks like in {\opp},
% or are they confined to the predefined blocks provided by the
% supplier? Some tools, like COMNET III, do not allow full programmability
% by the user, therefore, they cannot be directly compared to
% {\opp}. Specialized network simulation tools, such as NS (for IP)
% and CLASS (for ATM), also fall into this category.
%
%
% \textbf{Available Models.} \textit{What protocol models are readily available
% for the simulation tool?} As of the end of 2004, there were three major
% protocol modeling frameworks available for {\opp}:
% the Mobility Framework for modeling mobile, wireless, and ad-hoc networks;
% the INET Framework with TCP, IP, MPLS, and other Internet-related protocols;
% and IPv6Suite, which provides detailed models for IPv6, Mobile IPv6, 802.11,
% and other protocols. Additionally, several other simulation models (such as AntNet routing)
% have been published â€” the list continues to grow, and model frameworks
% are constantly improving and converging.
%
%
% \textbf{Defining Network Topology}. \textit{How does the simulation
% tool support the definition of network topology?} Is it possible to
% create some form of hierarchy (nesting), or does it only support "flat" topologies?
% Network simulation tools typically share the property
% that a model (network) consists of "nodes" (blocks, entities,
% modules, etc.) connected by "links" (channels, connections, etc.).
% Many commercial simulators have graphical editors to define the
% network; however, this is only a good solution if there is an
% alternative form of topology description (e.g., a text file) that allows
% generating the topology programmatically. OPNET follows a unique approach:
% the network topology is stored in a proprietary binary file format
% that can be generated (and read) by the graphical editor and C
% programs linked against a special library. On the other hand, most
% non-commercial simulation tools do not provide explicit support for
% topology description; instead, users must program a "driver entity" that will
% initialize the model by creating the necessary nodes and interconnecting
% them (PARSEC, SMURPH, NS). Finally, many tools that do
% support explicit topology description only support flat topologies
% (CLASS). {\opp} likely uses the most flexible method: it has a
% human-readable textual topology description format (the NED language)
% that is easy to create using any text-processing tool (\fprog{perl},
% \fprog{awk}, etc.), and the same format is used by the graphical
% editor. It is also possible to create a "driver entity" to build a
% network at runtime programmatically. {\opp} also supports submodule nesting.
%
%
% \textbf{Programming Model.} \textit{What programming model does the simulation
% environment support?} Network simulators typically use
% either thread/coroutine-based programming (like the \ffunc{activity()}
% function in {\opp}), or FSMs built upon a \ffunc{handleMessage()}-like function.
% For example, OPNET, SMURPH, and NetSim++ use FSMs (with an underlying
% handleMessage() function), while PARSEC and C++SIM use threads. {\opp} supports
% both programming models; the author is not aware of any other
% simulation tool that does so.
%
%
% \textbf{Debugging and Tracing Support.} \textit{What debugging or tracing
% facilities does the simulation tool offer?} Simulation programs
% are notorious for long debugging periods. C++-based simulation
% tools rarely offer much more than \ffunc{printf()}-style debugging; often
% the simulation kernel is also capable of dumping selected debug
% information to the standard output. Animation is also often supported,
% either offline (record and playback) or in some client-server architecture,
% where the simulation program is the "server"
% and can be viewed using the "client". Offline animation
% lacks interactivity and is therefore of little use for
% debugging. The client-server solution typically has limited capabilities
% because the simulation and the viewer run as independent operating
% system processes, and the viewer has limited access to the simulation
% program's internals and/or lacks sufficient control over
% the course of simulation execution. OPNET has very good support
% for command-line debugging and provides both offline and client-server
% style animation. NetSim++ and Ptolemy use the client-server method
% of animation. {\opp} takes a different approach by linking the GUI
% library with the debugging/tracing capability into the simulation
% executable. This architecture enables the GUI to be very powerful:
% every user-created object is visible (and modifiable) in the
% GUI via inspector windows, and the user has tight control over
% the execution. To the best of the author's knowledge, the tracing feature
% {\opp} provides is unique among C++-based simulation tools.
%
%
% \textbf{Performance.} \textit{What performance can be expected from the
% simulation?} Simulation programs typically run for several hours.
% The programming language is likely the most significant factor;
% almost all network simulation tools are C/C++-based. Performance
% is a particularly interesting issue with {\opp} since the GUI
% debugging/tracing support incurs some additional overhead in the
% simulation library. However, in a reported case, an {\opp} simulation
% was only 1.3 times slower than its counterpart implemented in plain
% C (i.e., one containing minimal administrative overhead),
% which is an impressive result. A similar outcome was reported in
% a performance comparison with a PARSEC simulation.
%
%
% \textbf{Source Availability.} \textit{Is the simulation library available
% in source code?} This may seem like a trivial question, but it becomes
% important if one wants to examine or teach the internal workings
% of a simulation kernel, or if one encounters trouble due to a bug or insufficient documentation
% in a simulation library function. In general, non-commercial
% tools (like {\opp}) are open-source, while commercial ones are not.
% This holds true for OPNET as well: the simulation kernel source
% code is not available (although the pre-built protocol models do
% come with source code).
%
%
% In conclusion, it can be said that {\opp} offers enough features
% to make it a good alternative to most network simulation tools,
% and it has the potential to become one of the most widely
% used network simulation packages in academic and research environments.

% \section{History}
% \label{sec:introduction:history}
%
% \textbf{The early days: 1992-1997}
%
% \textit{OMNeT++} has its distant roots in OMNeT, a simulator written
% in Object Pascal by Dr. Gy\"{o}rgy Pongor.
% The development of \textit{OMNeT++} started as a semester's programming
% assignment at the Technical University of Budapest (BME) in 1992.
% The assignment (``creation of an object-oriented discrete event
% simulation system in C++'') was handed out by Prof. Dr Gy\"{o}rgy
% Pongor, and two students signed up: \'{A}kos Kun and Andr\'{a}s Varga.
% The basis for the design was Mr. Pongor's existing simulation
% software written in Pascal, named OMNeT.
%
% We started developing the code in Borland C++ 3.1. The idea
% of multiple runtime environments, a significant addition to the
% original OMNeT design, was there from the very beginning.
% We used Turbo Vision (Borland's then successful character-based
% GUI) for the first ``graphical'' user interface.
%
% In 1992, we submitted a paper about \textit{OMNeT++} to the
% student's annual university conference
% (named ``TDK'') and won first prize in the ``Software'' section.
% Later we also won 1st prize in the national ``TDK''. Then the
% idea came to port \textit{OMNeT++} to Unix (first for AIX on an RS/6000
% with only 16MB RAM, later Linux), until all development was done
% in Linux and BC3.1 could no longer be supported.
%
% Well, here is a brief list of events since then -- maybe one time
% I'll make up my mind to enhance them to a whole story\dots
%
% 1994: XEnv (a GUI in pure MOTIF, superceded by Tkenv by now)
% was written as diploma work
%
% 1994: used OPNET for several simulation projects. OPNET features
% (and flaws) gave lots of ideas how to continue with \textit{OMNeT++}.

%
% 1997 Dec: added GNED
%
% \textbf{Regular open-source releases: 1997-2003}
%
% Until 1997, some people occasionally contributed to \textit{OMNeT++}.
% Since 1997, all development is done entirely by Andras;
% independent of the University since 1998. (He leaves
% the University in 1998, and is no longer affiliated with it
% since then.)
%

%
% \section{Credits}
% \label{sec:introduction:credits}
%
% {\omnetpp} was developed by Andr\'{a}s Varga (andras@omnetpp.org,
% andras.varga@omnest.com).
%
% In the early stages of the project, several people contributed
% to {\omnetpp}. Most of the contributed code is no longer part of
% {\omnetpp}; nevertheless, I would like to acknowledge the work of the
% following people. First of all, I want to thank Dr. Gy\"{o}rgy Pongor
% (pongor@hit.bme.hu), my advisor at the Technical University of Budapest
% who initiated {\omnetpp} as a student project.
%
% My fellow student \'{A}kos Kun started programming the first NED parser
% in 1992-93, but it was abandoned after a few months.
% The first version of nedc was finally developed in the summer of 1995,
% by three exchange students from TU Delft: Jan Heijmans, Alex Paalvast,
% and Robert van der Leij. nedc was initially called JAR after their initials
% until being renamed nedc. nedc was further developed and refactored
% several times until finally being retired and replaced by nedtool in {\omnetpp} 3.0.
% The second group of Delft exchange students (Maurits Andr\'{e},
% George van Montfort, Gerard van de Weerd) arrived in the fall of 1995.
% They performed some testing of the simulation library and
% wrote some example simulations, such as the original version of Token Ring,
% and a simulation of the NIM game which survived until {\omnetpp} 3.0.
% These student exchanges were organized by Dr. Leon Rothkranz
% at TU Delft and Gy\"{o}rgy Pongor at TU Budapest.
%
% The diploma thesis of Zolt\'{a}n Vass (spring 1996) was to prepare
% {\omnetpp} for parallel execution over PVM. This code has been
% replaced with the new Parallel Simulation Architecture in {\omnetpp} 3.0.
% G\'{a}bor Lencse (lencse@hit.bme.hu) was also interested in parallel
% simulation, namely a method called Statistical Synchronization (SSM).
% He implemented the FDDI model (which was retired in the 4.0 version) and added
% some extensions into NED for SSM. These extensions have since been removed
% ({\omnetpp} 3.0 does parallel execution using different principles).
%
% The $P^{2}$ algorithm and the original implementation of the k-split algorithm
% were programmed in the fall of 1996 by Babak Fakhamzadeh from TU Delft.
% k-split was later reimplemented by Andr\'{a}s.
%
% Several bugfixes and valuable suggestions for improvements came
% from the user community of {\omnetpp}. It would be impossible to
% mention everyone here, and the list is constantly growing --
% instead, the README and ChangeLog files contain acknowledgements.
%
% From the summer of 2001 to the fall of 2004, the {\omnetpp} CVS was hosted
% at the University of Karlsruhe. Credit for setting up and maintaining
% the CVS server goes to Ulrich Kaage.
% Ulrich can also be credited with converting the user manual from
% Microsoft Word format to LaTeX.
