\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:eventlog:introduction}

The eventlog feature and related tools have been added to {\opp} with the aim of
helping the user understand complex simulation models and correctly implement the
desired component behaviors. By using these tools, one can examine the details of the recorded
history of a simulation, focusing on the behavior rather than the statistical results.

The eventlog file is created automatically during a simulation run upon explicit request,
which can be configured in the ini file. The resulting file can be viewed in the {\opp} IDE using
the Sequence Chart and the Eventlog Table, or it can be processed by the command line Eventlog
Tool. These tools support filtering the collected data to allow you to focus on events
that are relevant to what you are looking for. They allow examining causality relationships and
provide filtering based on simulation times, event numbers, modules, and messages.

The simulation kernel records, among other things, user-level messages,
creation and deletion of modules, gates, and connections, scheduling of self-messages,
sending of messages to other modules either through gates or directly, and processing of
messages (that is, events). Optionally, detailed message data can also be automatically
recorded based on a message filter. The result is an eventlog file that contains detailed
information of the simulation run and can later be used for various purposes.

\begin{note}
    The eventlog file may become quite large for long-running simulations
    (often hundreds of megabytes, but occasionally several gigabytes), especially
    when message detail recording is turned on.
\end{note}

\section{Configuration}
\label{sec:eventlog:configuration}

To record an eventlog file during the simulation, insert the following line into the ini file:

\begin{inifile}
record-eventlog = true
\end{inifile}

\begin{note}
    Eventlog recording is turned off by default because creating the eventlog
    file might significantly decrease the overall simulation performance.
\end{note}

\subsection{File Name}
\label{sec:eventlog:file-name}

The simulation kernel will write the eventlog file during the simulation into
the file specified by the following ini file configuration entry (showing the
default file name pattern here):

\begin{inifile}
eventlog-file = ${resultdir}/${configname}-${runnumber}.elog
\end{inifile}

\subsection{Recording Intervals}
\label{sec:eventlog:recording-intervals}

The size of an eventlog file is approximately proportional to the number of
events it contains. To reduce the file size and speed up the simulation, it
might be useful to record only certain events. The
\ttt{eventlog-recording-intervals} configuration option instructs the kernel to
record events only in the specified intervals. The syntax is similar to that of
\ttt{vector-recording-intervals}.

An example:

\begin{inifile}
eventlog-recording-intervals = ..10.2, 22.2..100, 233.3..
\end{inifile}

\subsection{Recording Modules}
\label{sec:eventlog:recording-modules}

Another factor that affects the size of an eventlog file is the number of
modules for which the simulation kernel records events during the simulation.
The \ttt{module-eventlog-recording} per-module configuration option instructs
the kernel to record only the events that occurred in the matching modules. The
default is to record events from all modules. This configuration option only
applies to simple modules.

The following example records events from any of the routers whose index is
between 10 and 20 and turns off recording for all other modules.

\begin{inifile}
**.router[10..20].**.module-eventlog-recording = true
**.module-eventlog-recording = false
\end{inifile}

\subsection{Recording Message Data}
\label{sec:eventlog:recording-messages}

Since recording message data dramatically increases the size of the eventlog
file and also slows down the simulation, it is turned off by default, even if
writing the eventlog is enabled. To turn on message data recording, supply a
value for the \ttt{eventlog-message-detail-pattern} option in the ini file.

%TODO explain the syntax a little bit... it is not trivial

%TODO: how to record all details?  =* ? test!

An example configuration for an IEEE 80211 model that records the
\ttt{encapsulationMsg} field and all other fields whose name ends in
\ttt{Address}, from messages whose class name ends with \ttt{Frame}, looks like
this:

\begin{inifile}
eventlog-message-detail-pattern = *Frame:encapsulatedMsg,*Address
\end{inifile}

An example configuration for a TCP/IP model that records the port and address
fields in all network packets looks like the following:

\begin{inifile}
eventlog-message-detail-pattern =
 PPPFrame:encapsulatedPacket|IPDatagram:encapsulatedPacket,*Address|TCPSegment:*Port
\end{inifile}

% TODO : Assuming you have a message type named \ttt{WirelessFrame}, the following
% option records -- what?
%
% \begin{inifile}
% eventlog-message-detail-pattern = WirelessFrame:declaredOn(WirelessFrame) or bitLength
%\end{inifile}


\section{Eventlog Tool}
\label{sec:eventlog:eventlog-tool}

The Eventlog Tool is a command-line tool for processing eventlog files. Invoking it without
parameters will display usage information. The following are the most useful commands for users.

\subsection{Filter}
\label{sec:eventlog:filter}

The eventlog tool provides offline filtering that is usually applied to the eventlog file
after the simulation has finished and before actually opening it in the {\opp} IDE
or processing it by any other means. Use the filter command and its various options to
specify what should be present in the result file.

\subsection{Echo}
\label{sec:eventlog:echo}

Since the eventlog file format is text-based and users are encouraged to implement their
own filters, a way is needed to check whether an eventlog file is
correct. The echo command provides a way to check this and helps users create custom
filters. Anything not echoed back by the eventlog tool will not be taken into
consideration by the other tools found in the {\opp} IDE.

\begin{note}
    Custom filter tools should only filter out whole events; otherwise, the
    consequences are undefined.
